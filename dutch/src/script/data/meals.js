        instructions: "Melt the butter in a skillet or pan. When melted, add the flour little by little and stir into a thick paste. Slowly stir in the stock, making sure the roux absorbs the liquid. Simmer for a couple of minutes on a low heat while you stir in the onion, parsley and the shredded meat. The mixture should thicken and turn into a heavy, thick sauce.\r\n\r\nPour the mixture into a shallow container, cover and refrigerate for several hours, or until the sauce has solidified.\r\n\r\nTake a heaping tablespoon of the cold, thick sauce and quickly roll it into a small ball. Roll lightly through the flour, then the egg and finally the breadcrumbs. Make sure that the egg covers the whole surface of the bitterbal. When done, refrigerate the snacks while the oil in your fryer heats up to 190C (375F). Fry four bitterballen at a time, until golden.\r\n\r\nServe on a plate with a nice grainy or spicy mustard. \r\n"

        instructions: "Gather the ingredients.\r\n\r\nIn a large soup pot, bring water, split peas, pork belly or bacon, pork chop, and bouillon cube to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and let cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam that rises to the top. \r\n\r\nRemove the pork chop, debone, and thinly slice the meat. Set aside.\r\n\r\nAdd the celery, carrots, potato, onion, leek, and celeriac to the soup. Return to the boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook, uncovered, for another 30 minutes, adding a little extra water if the ingredients start to stick to the bottom of the pot.\r\n\r\nAdd the smoked sausage for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. When the vegetables are tender, remove the bacon and smoked sausage, slice thinly and set aside.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a smooth consistency, purée the soup with a stick blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the meat back to the soup, setting some slices of rookworst aside.\r\n\r\nServe in heated bowls or soup plates, garnished with slices of rookworst and chopped celery leaf.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"

        instructions: "\r\nWash and peel the potatoes and cut into similarly sized pieces for even cooking.\r\n\r\nIn a large soup pot, boil the potatoes and the bay leaves in salted water for 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using a bag of ready-cut curly kale, wash the bunches thoroughly under cool running water to get rid of all soil—you wouldn't want that gritty texture in your finished dish. Trim any coarse stems and discard any brown leaves. With a sharp knife, cut the curly kale into thin strips.\r\n\r\nPeel and chop the shallots.\r\n\r\nIn a frying pan or skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of butter and saute the shallots for a few minutes before adding the curly kale and 2 tbsp. of water. Season and cook for about 10 minutes, or until tender.\r\n\r\nWarm the milk on the stove or in the microwave.\r\n\r\nDrain, shake and dry the potatoes with kitchen towels before mashing with a potato masher or ricer. Working quickly, add the warm milk and the remaining butter. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. \r\n\r\nMix the cooked curly kale through the cooked mashed potato mixture.\r\n\r\nTop with slices of the smoked sausage and serve hot with your favorite mustard or gravy.\r\n\r\nServe and enjoy!"
